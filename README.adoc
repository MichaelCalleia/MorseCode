Morse Code uses dots and dashes to communicate with
signals that can be sent using sound or light.

This library contains functions for: all of the letters
in the alphabet, some accented letters, the numbers 0–9
and Procedural Signals (prosigns) for formatting, using Morse Code.

You can use a Piezo Buzzer, LED or both

You can use this Sketch to create your own Morse Code communicator.

There are options below to use a piezo buzzer or an LED.
